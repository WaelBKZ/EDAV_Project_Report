# Conclusion

The massive amount of data in our disposal means that we had to severely restrain the subset of information used for analysis.
But with even 1.3% of the data used (1GB/80GB) we managed to get interesting information. 

We managed to generate a global rating to measure the performance of teams and players (5.1-5.3). The game data used to get insights on the team's play styles and habits (5.4 and 6). And we showed the game's balance evolution throughout the years (5.5).

That being said, there is still a lot to analyse with the rest of the data that was unused. For examples we did not cover the economy aspect of the game: different weapon buying decisions from the players can impact the rest of the game. 

Also while we had a look at player's positions in a match, a more precise round by round analysis can get more information on specific team strategies. However this would have necessitated players' position at frequent intervals which would increase the dataset size by a considerable margin.
