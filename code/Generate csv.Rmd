## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}

heat_kills <- damages %>%  filter(map_name == "de_mirage" ) %>% filter(match_event=="StarLadder Major Berlin 2019") 
heat_kills

heat_kills[,c("attackerX","attackerY","victimSide","victimX","victimY")]

write.csv(heat_kills[,c("attackerX","attackerY","victimSide","victimX","victimY")],"D3/csv/test.csv", row.names = FALSE, quote=FALSE)
```
