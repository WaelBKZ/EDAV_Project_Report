This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
```{r}
library(jsonlite)
match <- jsonlite::fromJSON("ALL_kills.json", simplifyVector = TRUE)
```
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
head(match)
test <- match %>%  group_by(round_num, match_num,attackerSteamID) %>% summarise(kills=n(),Name=last(attackerName))
test
test <- test %>%  group_by(attackerSteamID) %>%  summarise(tot_kills=sum(kills),tot_rounds=n(),name=first(Name)) %>% mutate(kpr=tot_kills/tot_rounds)
test <- test %>% arrange( -kpr,-tot_rounds)
test
```

```{r}
match <- jsonlite::fromJSON("ALL_damages.json", simplifyVector = TRUE)

test <- test %>%  group_by(attackerSteamID) %>%  summarise(tot_damage=sum(damage),tot_rounds=n(),name=first(Name)) %>% mutate(avg_damage=tot_damage/tot_rounds)
test <- test %>% arrange( -avg_damage,-tot_rounds)
