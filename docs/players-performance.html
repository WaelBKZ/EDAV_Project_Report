<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 7</span> Players performance</h1>
<p>Events and websites like HLTV generally focus on players’s performance on individual events. However it would be interesting to look at a player’s performance across all event. This would smooth out players that had unexpectedly good or bad performance in an event.</p>
<p><img src="finalproj_files/figure-html/topplayers-1.png" width="672" />
The player Autimatic has the highest rating of all, and has one win with his team Cloud9 in the Boston Major. Interestingly, Zywoo, s1mple and device are the immediate 3 highest rated players after autimatic. The fact that those three players where nominated in the top 3 players in 2019 and 2020 by the <a href="hltv.org">HLTV</a> website means that our combined rating reflects the differnet ratings of other sites such as HLTV.</p>
<p>It is often hard to compare teams and players across events becasue of players often change teams.
<img src="finalproj_files/figure-html/alluvial%20-1.png" width="1248" />
One of the most successful teams is Astralis with 3 Major wins. A core of 3 players (dupreeh, device, and Xyp9x) have been playing together for 10 events explaining the team’s consistent success.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.1</span> Use in-game data to have the competitive advantage</h2>
<p>The matches game data is available everyone and pro teams always watch their opponent previous games to come up with strategies to counter their opponents.</p>
<p>However, watching games takes time. Some parts of this process can be automated.</p>
<p>Even though it does not give informations such as teams reactions to specific events, 2d-density maps can give the general trends, and habits of a player of a team.</p>
<p>For instance, one of the hardest player to play against is s1mple, especially with the AWP weapon because of its range. Parsing the game data allows to know where players can expect s1mple to be and where he can be aiming at with his weapon.</p>
<p><img src="finalproj_files/figure-html/densitymap%20-1.png" width="672" />
Knowing the habits of a player and the positions where it is dangerous to be at can avoid being surprised by the enemy and helps to come up with strategies to counter the enemy team.</p>

<div id="game-evolution-and-balance" class="section level2" number="7.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.2</span> Game evolution and balance</h2>
<p>People often attribute the success and longevity of the CSGO game to its balance, meaning at both teams have an equal chance of winning. However, this is difficult to achieve as it depends on multiple factors such as the weapon characteristics and map layout.</p>
<p>Because the developpers have been continuously updating the maps and weapon characterstics, the probablity to win a round on the T/CT sides has changed over the years.</p>
<p><img src="finalproj_files/figure-html/winrates-1.png" width="672" />
The drop in the win percentage differences after 2016 can be attributed to the update of the nuke, inferno and overpass maps. Maps updates often include changes in the layout to give more advantage to a given side.</p>
<p><img src="finalproj_files/figure-html/mapwinrates-1.png" width="1440" />
Nuke as been removed from the official maps after Katowice 2015 and reintroduced for Cologne 2016. It was known to greatly favor the CT side, often forcing the team starting on the T side to have an impressing comeback after switching sides on the half time.
But after the nuke map update the balance greatly improved.</p>
<p>Note that the map pool changes for every event. The latest map being introduced is vertigo. Because it is a new map, it is not as balanced as the other ones.</p>
<p>Weapons also impact the game balance.</p>
<p><img src="finalproj_files/figure-html/weaponusage%20-1.png" width="768" />
Change the developers change a weapon’s characteristic such as damage output, it can lead to a drop or spike in popularity.</p>
<p>For example,in 2017 they tried to increase the usage of smg type weapons by increasing their damage output. As a result, the ump was often used by teams when they could not get a rifle. But complains from pro players meant that the update was reverted.</p>
<p>The same can be said for the cz-75 in 2018. Also, the p250, five-seven and tec-9 had their damage and accuracy decreased over the years and resulted in a drop in usages by the pro players.</p>
<p>Finally, it happens that players discover that a weapon can be very effective, even without its characteristics being changed. This is what happened in 2019 when players started to use the AUG and the SG 553 weapons for their good accuracy at long range.</p>
